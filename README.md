# F1 Constructors

A React-based web application that showcases and describes Formula 1 constructors.  
The project provides an easy-to-browse overview of all current F1 teams, including essential information, history, and key details.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to deliver a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to explore Formula 1 constructors in one place.  
Each constructor includes structured information such as:

- Team name  
- Country  
- Founding year  
- Championship wins  
- General description  

The app is ideal for F1 fans who want a quick reference to all constructors.

## How It Works

- Built with **React** and **Vite** for fast development and efficient builds.  
- Uses **react-router-dom** to handle client-side navigation between different views (e.g., teams list, team details).  
- Designed as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** for smooth transitions and fast interaction.  
- Simple, extendable structure — new teams or views can be added easily by updating data and components.

## Technologies & Dependencies

Key libraries used:

- **React** — UI framework  
- **Vite** — build tool and dev server  
- **react-router-dom** — routing and navigation  
- (Optional) Any CSS framework you choose  

All necessary dependencies are listed in `package.json`.
